I purchase my wedding dress 5 years ago as my partner and I were planning to get married in 2020 but then covid happened. My dress was in a bag in my closet for 5 years and when I took it out it was wrinkly and creased. I did some research and based on reviews and pics from other buyers I decided to purchase this product. When I received the package the box was very small so I thought I would be disappointment, but let me tell you....this little machine does the work that it's meant for. Very simple to put together and once you put water in the water dispenser all you have to do is turn it on and it takes about one minute or so to start producing steam. I was able to iron steam by wedding dress in less than 10 minutes without having to add more water to the water compartment.
